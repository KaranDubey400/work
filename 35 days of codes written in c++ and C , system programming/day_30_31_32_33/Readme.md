 Terminal-Based car simulator

 Built a real time car simulation in C using ncurses with throttle, braking, steering, gears, and fuel logic
 Implemented physics-based motion (acceleration, drag, heading, position updates) using fixed time steps
 Designed automatic gear shifting and fuel consumption model
 managed real-time keyboard input and rendering loop using POSIX APIs


 compile code using command in linux = gcc file.c -o outputfile -lncurses -lm

 run ./outputfile
